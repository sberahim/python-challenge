There are two parts in this project.

First part - Financial Analysis

Create a program to read dataset from a CSV file and calculate the difference in term of the profit/loss on each month and determine which month has the highest profit as well as the lowest profit. 

Second part - Election Results

Create a similar type of program that read the dataset from CSV file for the election results and find the name of the candidate, the total number of votes, the vote percentage for each candidate as well as determine which candidate won the election.
